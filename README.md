# Wind-Turbine

## Objective

The objective is to model the power generated by a wind turbine using the given set of equations and parameters. This includes developing a computational model to calculate the power generated based on input parameters like wind speed (\(V_W\)), pitch angle (\(\beta\)), and rotational speed (\(\omega_T\)). The results will be visualized by plotting the power output (\(P_{\text{Wind}}\)) against different input parameters like wind speed and blade length to analyze the turbine's performance.

 - This equation calculates the wind power captured by the turbine.
 **Key Variables and Their Impact:**
- \(P_t\): Power extracted by the wind turbine.
- \(V_W\): Wind speed.
- \(A_T\): Rotor area.
- \(\rho\): Air density.
- \(C_P\): Output coefficient or power coefficient.

3. **Power Coefficient (C_P)**:

   - This equation defines the power coefficient, which is a function of the tip-speed ratio (\(\lambda\)) and the pitch angle (\(\beta\)).

5. **Tip-Speed Ratio (\(\lambda\))**:

    - This equation adjusts the tip-speed ratio based on the optimal tip-speed ratio (\(\lambda_{\text{opt}}\)) and the pitch angle (\(\beta\)).

7. **Intermediate Tip-Speed Ratio (\(\lambda_t\))**:

    - This equation relates the intermediate tip-speed ratio to the turbine's rotational speed (\(\omega_T\)), the turbine radius (\(r_T\)), and the wind speed (\(V_W\)).

9. **Constants**:
